Hi boo, 

I'm sitting here coding right now and you're at your event doing what you do best and making spaces look wonderful, even when the host is a litte bit of a turd lol.  I've been meaning to write you something for awhile now just to tell you how much you mean to me and to make sure you really know.  Hopefully this helps and makes you smile if nothing else (I think I've used that line before sorry, but seriously lol).  I know I still have a lot of work to do with affection and will never let that thought slip my mind.  I love you dearly.
